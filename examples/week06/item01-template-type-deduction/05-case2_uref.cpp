/*
 * Key idea:
 *
 *   Considering the general form for templates and calls to it:
 *
 *     template <typename T>
 *     void f(ParamType param);
 *
 *     f(expr);                // deduce T and ParamType from expr
 *
 *   then, in the case when ParamType is a universal reference
 *   type, type deduction works like this:
 *
 *   * If expr is an lvalue, both T and ParamType are deduced to be lvalue
 *     references
 *   * If expr is an rvalue, the usual type deduction rules apply.
