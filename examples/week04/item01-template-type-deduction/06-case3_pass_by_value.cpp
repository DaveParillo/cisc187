/*
 * Key idea:
 *
 *   If we're dealing with pass-by-value
 *
 *     template <typename T>
 *     void f(T param);        // param is now passed by value
 *
 *   That means that param will be a copy of whatever is passed in - a
 *   completely new object.  The fact that param will be a new object motivates
 *   the rules that govern how T is deduced from expr:
 *
 *   1. As before, if expr's type is a reference, ignore the reference part.
 *
 *   2. If, after ignoring expr's reference-ness, expr is const, ignore that,
 *      too.  If it's volatile, also ignore that. (volatile objects are uncommon.
 *      They're generally used only for implementing device drivers.)
