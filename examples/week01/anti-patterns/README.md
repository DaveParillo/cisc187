
Bad example source code
=======================

An 'anti-pattern' is an example of what _not_ to do to solve a particular problem.
From wikipedia:
  ... a common response to a recurring problem that is usually ineffective ...


The examples in this directory are examples of how not to solve a given problem.

Sadly, most of these was downloaded from the internet and was presented as something
a beginning programmer could use and learn from.

And for the record, you can write 
[bad code](https://github.com/Droogans/unmaintainable-code) in any language.
