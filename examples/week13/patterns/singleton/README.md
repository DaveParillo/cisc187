# Singleton Pattern

Hated by many.
The singleton pattern is in effect a global object. 

The singleton pattern is one of the simplest design patterns, but 
the simplicity is decpetive.
A singleton is a class which 
 - instantiates itself, 
 - Ensures at most one instance exists; 
 - Provides a global point of access to that instance.

There are many examples on the internet of this pattern implemented incorrectly.
Certainly, people will find fault with this one, too.
