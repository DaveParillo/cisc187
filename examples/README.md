
Course example source code
==========================

The examples are organized by week, one for each week of the semester.

The examples in week 1 are provided as review.
The examples in the week 1 directory should be familiar and easy to understand.

If there is anything about the week 1 examples that you have questions about, bring it up 
as soon as possible, because these are things I assume you already know.

Some examples include test cases.
A few are Boost.Test tests.
Some are doctest tests.

You can use the boost already nstalled on buffy, but off campus, you will need to install your own copy.

Everything you need to use doctest is included in this directory.

More information on 
[Boost.Test is here] (http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_65_1/libs/test/doc/html/index.html).


More information on [doctest is here](http://bit.ly/doctest-docs).

Each week contains a 'book' directory.
These examples come directly from the _Programming Principles_ textbook.
In a few cases, I have fixed or clarified or extended a book example.
These examples will always be 'pulled up' to the directory containing 'book'.

That is, I keep CISC course examples separate from those provided by the text.

Book examples that are very broken or might cause harm if run have 'no-link' in their names.

The makefiles provided will not link these examples, so they can't be accidentally executed.

Some weeks contain directories named 'itemNN', where NN is a 2 digit number.

These examples are drawn from one of the Effective C++ books,
either Effective C++, More Effective C++, or Effective STL.

The source example annotates the exact reference when used.
