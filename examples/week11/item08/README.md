
# Obey the 'General Contract' when overriding equals

## Item 08

The examples in this directory are a C++ port of an example in
Effective Java - Pages 37 - 38.

Joshua Bloch does a good job explaining the problem
and note that this is largely a problem related to object oriented programming in general
It's not a "C++" or a "Java" problem.
